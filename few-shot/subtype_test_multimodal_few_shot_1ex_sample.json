What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7342657742412188971\nCaption: #carporn #therapy #foryoupage #2024 #fyp #depresion #carsoftiktok #gym #storm #v8engine #depressionanxiety #pain\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: I'm a man I'll be fine.. don't let off!\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7363214506379562248\nCaption: Replying to @rai this is every aspect of what to do when dieting this crazy.

That's an eight kilo loss in just three weeks. Warning, there will be a bunch of MILFs in your DMs. We'll be going over the fundamentals of nutrition, sleep, training, cardio, and then what to do after your cut. For nutrition, you need to be eating around 1,500 calories. You can go a little bit higher, a little bit lower, but you need to be hitting 200 grams of protein. This is my exact diet. Screenshot it, save it, I don't care. Do whatever you want to it. I know 1,500 calories seems like nothing, but you need to do it if you want rapid fat loss and to keep most of your muscle. That's why your protein's high. For sleep, you need seven to eight hours. If you're getting less than that, there's no point going on such an aggressive cut because you will be losing strength, which then means you're gonna be losing muscle. So please, seven to eight hours, that is a must. For training, it is just easiest if you do a push-pull leg split. That means you train everything twice per week. You have to realize that your training at this point is just to strictly keep that muscle, which means you need to be training as hard as possible. You need to be training two failure or at least like one rep in reserve. I'd recommend doing two to four sets per muscle per workout. That way it's low volume. Cardio-wise, you wanna be doing 10,000 steps per day. That means you're just gonna be in such a large deficit. This is what mine looked like. I'd be doing 15, sometimes even 20,000. Those are on the days I'd work, so I'd eat a little bit more just to compensate. And just a pro tip, do cardio you enjoy. I like surfing, so I'd be doing surfing. Otherwise, I'd be getting like 10,000 steps minimum a day. And finally, what should you do after your aggressive cut? As you can see here, I finished mine right here. I then just started eating at maintenance. So I'd be consistent all along here, and then I just started to bulk recently. Personally, I believe you should eat at maintenance or just start bulking after, just as like a body recomposition, because you've just put such a stressful period on your body. I'm not gatekeeping any information. This is the exact process I use, so save it if you're gonna find it useful.\nEmbedded text: Complete Aggressive Cut Guide (90kg-82kg in 3 weeks) how do I aggressive cut? *Warning* Nutrition Sleep Training Cardio What to do after cut?

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7213478016519769350\nCaption: It has how much protein, you say? #thefitadam #protein #fitnesscomedy\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: MEME NEWS MEME ZAR GYMHHEADS ARE EATING DOG FOOD DUE TO ITS HIGH PROTEIN CONTENT\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7259533689980210475\nCaption: #28daycleanse #chronicillness #medicalmedium #foodismedicine #interstitialcystisis #livingwell #cheatmeal\nAudio transcript: It's day 28 of the 28 day medical medium cleanse Full disclosure. I did have a few cheats over the course of these 28 days some indulgent meals out with friends totally worth it, but 95% of this 28 days has been compliant with the Medical medium protocol, which is like celery juice on an empty stomach every morning lemon water and whole fruits and vegetables and I feel like the most important thing That I got out of this aside from just feeling better overall was a heightened awareness of how much every single thing we put in our body impacts our health and just overall well-being and I intend to continue eating probably 90-95% In compliance with this same sort of diet or protocol I definitely don't I'm not cured by any means, but I've had the last six days have been really low pain And like what a reprieve it's such a relief to have just a few days And you know, I just feel like I have to continue being extremely mindful of everything that I consume and To give my body the best chance of healing. So the goal is to continue eating like this and I am so thankful for Everybody who like supported and encouraged me The jerk having chronically unwell really wears on you mentally and So much of this like last 28 days was really just like me fighting for myself and like Sort of like getting my mental strength back and feeling empowered over my health so I want to keep that sense of empowerment and You know Continue taking the best possible care of myself. So if I have any updates along the way I will be sure to record a video and share with anybody else who might be struggling with Something similar to what I have or any kind of mystery illness Because it's just really comforting to like not feel alone in this. So anyway thanks for all the support and And I made it.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7474758861778423070\nCaption: Proof Anavar + Dedication works wonders #steroid #anavar #bodybuilder #steroidtransformation #testosterone\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: After 2 months on Anavar Me 2 months before\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg. Uh really in an off season, 100 mg is the max that I would probably ever take it to. just because the side effects are so prevalent and once you start getting the side effects it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're gonna have to pull the plug eventually. So uh Ace is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects you can pull it out, but 400 mg is where you will side effects in a very short period of time. uh probably within about a four week period of time you're probably gonna get some sleep disruption as well. some emotional anxiety at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not of a really well tolerated number. me personally in all season 100 mg of max I would ever take Tren to. in fact I probably wouldn't even use Tren because side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 mg of Masteron propionate. Now 600 mg of Masteron propionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 mg, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now, on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neuroproductivity. So, protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 or 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masteron for most guys, not all, but most. Now, 75 mg of Androl. Now, I really like Androl. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7335980044516412703\nCaption: Girl therapy #fyp #therapy #gym #gymtok #fitness #motivation #fittok\nAudio transcript: Sorry I can't come to the phone right now, I'm a little bit busy with girl therapy, but I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7432439766609726766\nCaption: Trust the process, it doesn't happen overnight... @Joshua VMH #trtdad #trt #testosterone #lowt #gym #gymbro #gymbros #gymtok #fitdad #exercise #Meme #weightlifting\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: me after pinning Testosterone and hitting a new PR on bench...

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7202388211086298414\nCaption: Theres just something nostalgic about our perfectly made DEEP FRIED OREOS! #MANNYSWEETREATS #LongIsland #NewYork #NY #Hartford #Connecticut #food #tiktokfood #yum #delicious #fyp #foryou #fyp #oreos #deepfriedoreos #tasty #cheatday #dessert\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: N/A\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7101781995952377093\nCaption: 5 stage process from skinny to muscular #gymbromotivation #gymtransformation #bulkedup #gymgrind #gymdedication\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: They say there are 5 stages of being skinny...

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7475622829732498693\nCaption: Testosterone is the hormone that makes a man a man, it takes care of all the masculine features of a man as well as his bedroom performance & his reproductive health.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now, on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neuroproductivity. So, protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 or 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masteron for most guys, not all, but most. Now, 75 mg of Androl. Now, I really like Androl. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7350759886193429792\nCaption: TREN ACE | EXPERIMENT wk 1 #fyp #foryoupage #enhancedbodybuilder #bodybuilding #steroids #steroid #steroidtalk #tren #trenbolon #trenace #trenacetate #trenilations #trenexperiment #steroidawareness\nAudio transcript: The Tren Experiment.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7206879173695049006\nCaption: What i eat in a day to run a 10k during half marathon training. #halfmarathontraining #halfmarathon #fitness #running #10k #whatieatinaday #fulldayofeating #food #foodtok #gym #lifting\nAudio transcript: Here's what I ate in a day before and after running a 10K.

Downed a coffee a couple hours before the run, then started to stretch out and warm up, also took one Tylenol before the run. Had a little warm up run before the 10K, and absolutely smashed my goal of sub 40 minutes with a 38.04 time. I also had really good food for this one, pancakes and sausage, and two ground turkey and cheese enchiladas. Then after a few hours, had a couple butter jelly toasts and two tangerines. Hit legs and biceps at the gym, then backwards on a treadmill, and then went on a little walk. And for dinner, had a couple more enchiladas with some salsa. Ended off the night with a banana, two butter jelly toasts.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7474350307405876510\nCaption: I havent had a good burger in so long. #prep#bodybuilding#real#muscles#chicken#rice#turkey#posing#gymtok#fyp#gym#gymrat\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Eating straight dog food so I can post a physique worthy of this song\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7453111975984254238\nCaption: CLEAN BULKING HACK\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Clean Bulking is too easy.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7284004788809813290\nCaption: #cheatday #legdayworkout #salesmen #closeout happy eating.... knowing, I wouldn't gain a single pound\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: cheat day!!!

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7201940833388612870\nCaption: #gymtok #bodybuilding #emotional #sad #fitness #zyzz #alphamale #deep #fyp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: how 40kg moves How 45kg moves\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7249885949658811691\nCaption: Who should or shouldnt eat after working out? You SHOULD if. Youre in a calorie deficit. You train early in the mornings before a substantial meal. You raid the pantry and scarf down all the Cheetos as soon as you get home. Im definitely the latter, so I make sure to have some high protein snack at the ready because ya girl gets HUNGRY. Do you eat after your workouts? Whats your go-to post workout snack? #workingouttips #nutritiontips #fitnessgoals #eatright #postworkoutnutrition #womensfitnesstips #workoutscience\nAudio transcript: I need to eat after working out? So I've heard this question quite a few times for my clients and the answer is it depends. There's a few different factors that go into whether or not you need to eat shortly after your workout. You might hear a lot about the 30 to 60 minute window where if you don't eat then you're eating away at muscle. There is some validity to that but again it depends on the individual and the phase they're in. If you are in a calorie deficit and especially if you're working out first thing in the morning before you have a substantial meal it is definitely important to get some protein and some fast-acting carbohydrates after your workout. Now if you are more so in a calorie surplus and you train in the middle or evening it's not as important to rush and scarf things down. However if after your workout you are ravenous whether you're in a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus and you go home and you raid the pantry probably is a good idea to bring something with you for after the gym so you don't immediately go on autopilot on the Cheetos.\nEmbedded text: DO I NEED TO OUT?

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg. Uh really in an off season, 100 mg is the max that I would probably ever take it to. just because the side effects are so prevalent and once you start getting the side effects it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're gonna have to pull the plug eventually. So uh Ace is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects you can pull it out, but 400 mg is where you will side effects in a very short period of time. uh probably within about a four week period of time you're probably gonna get some sleep disruption as well. some emotional anxiety at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not of a really well tolerated number. me personally in all season 100 mg of max I would ever take Tren to. in fact I probably wouldn't even use Tren because side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 mg of Masteron propionate. Now 600 mg of Masteron propionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 mg, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

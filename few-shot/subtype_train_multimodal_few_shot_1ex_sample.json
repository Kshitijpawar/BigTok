What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7318182937743166763\nCaption: Testosterone Talk.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7318925629338963242\nCaption: My secret \ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\udc47\u2728!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Comment \u201cWe got this!\u201d For the details on the changes I made that helped me so much!

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7184034244820323627\nCaption: #duet with @bayashi.tiktok #TikTokFood major unexpected plot twist Testcle King approves #horsemeat #rawhorsemeat #asianfood #rawmeat #rawmeatdiet #rawegg #carnivore #carnivorediet #fyp #foryou #froyoupage #viral #trending #recipes #cooking #food #foodie #primal #paulylong #foodreaction #foodtiktok\nAudio transcript: Alright, I honestly hate everything this guy makes so I'm prepared to be disappointed but horse meat here we go This is a new one for me.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg. Uh really in an off season, 100 mg is the max that I would probably ever take it to. just because the side effects are so prevalent and once you start getting the side effects it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're gonna have to pull the plug eventually. So uh Ace is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects you can pull it out, but 400 mg is where you will side effects in a very short period of time. uh probably within about a four week period of time you're probably gonna get some sleep disruption as well. some emotional anxiety at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not of a really well tolerated number. me personally in all season 100 mg of max I would ever take Tren to. in fact I probably wouldn't even use Tren because side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 mg of Masteron propionate. Now 600 mg of Masteron propionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 mg, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now, on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neuroproductivity. So, protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 or 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masteron for most guys, not all, but most. Now, 75 mg of Androl. Now, I really like Androl. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7.167058185663041e+18\nCaption: its getting ridiculous now #gym #gymtok #gymhumour #gymcouple #fyp #viral #gymproblems #trending #gymboyf\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: POV: Your boyfriend always puts gym before you\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching. Peace out.\nEmbedded text: GHK-CU update\nClassification: Legal APEDs\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: so jealous, just wish I was over there!!

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7.219462038874131e+18\nCaption: How bad fo you want it? #fyp #motivation #gym #gymtok #gymmotivation #hardwork #tired #tiredbutkeepgoing #keepgoing #work #workout #greenscreen #tiktok #love #lovethegym #gymrat #gymlife #personaltrainer #trainer #fitness #fitnesstips\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @devon_mac\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7.375547668258394e+18\nCaption: 3 months of consistency!

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7279742820133522695\nCaption: never enough. #gym #gymmotivation #motivation #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: \"Don't bulk, you're big enough\" Enough?

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7.388606944396922e+18\nCaption: The perfect alarm?? #motivation #gymtok #gymmotivation #gym #gymmotivation #goggins #gogginsmentality #gogginsmotivation #davidgogginsmindset #davidgoggins\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: The perfect alarm?

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7478387977559837974\nCaption: Its my body dysmorphia #gymrat#gymmotivation#fitnessmotivation#gains#bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @lucia.mikusova\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7322893473214975265\nCaption: Body dysmorphia is real | #17 #17yo #motivational #trend #gym #sport #gymbro\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: \"MY BODY IS PERFECT\" \"MY BODY IS PERFECT\" \"MY BODY IS PERFECT\" \"I HATE MY BODY\" \"I HATE MY BODY\" \"I HATE MY BODY\" \"I HATE MY BODY\" \"I HATE MY BODY\" \"I HATE MY BODY\"\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg. Uh really in an off season, 100 mg is the max that I would probably ever take it to. just because the side effects are so prevalent and once you start getting the side effects it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're gonna have to pull the plug eventually. So uh Ace is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects you can pull it out, but 400 mg is where you will side effects in a very short period of time. uh probably within about a four week period of time you're probably gonna get some sleep disruption as well. some emotional anxiety at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not of a really well tolerated number. me personally in all season 100 mg of max I would ever take Tren to. in fact I probably wouldn't even use Tren because side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 mg of Masteron propionate. Now 600 mg of Masteron propionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 mg, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now, on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neuroproductivity. So, protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 or 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masteron for most guys, not all, but most. Now, 75 mg of Androl. Now, I really like Androl. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7.417634990982221e+18\nCaption: Its all about balance.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7421332338090511659\nCaption: #gymmotivation #gym #gymtok #aesthetic #veins #fyp #viralvideo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: moises_arrendell\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7319363399467486495\nCaption: #mentalhealth #journeytowellness #selfcompassion #selfempowerment #letitgo #selfcareisntselfish #mindfulness #anxiety #affirmations #selfacceptance #mensmentalhealth #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #menshealth #mentalhealthmatters #mensmentalhealthawareness #anxiety #depression #suicideprevention #mensmentalhealthmatters #selfcare #men #itsokaynottobeokay #mentalillness #mentalhealthwarrior #womensmentalhealth #mentalhealthsupport #mentalhealthadvocate #selflove #recovery #motivation #love #menswellbeing #mentalhealthrecovery #fitness #youarenotalone #endthestigma #therapy #healing #breakthestigma\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a #warrior #keepfightingforward #youareawesome #youareenough #youareworthy\ud83d\udc9c #fyp #fyp\u30b7 #fyp\u30b7\u309aviral #youaresomeonesreasontosmile #mentalhealthmatters #keeponkeepingon #healing #love #selflove #meditation #gratitudeattitude #mentalhealth #health #mindfulness #wellness #spirituality #motivation #spiritual #yoga #life #inspiration #energy #peace #happiness #spiritualawakening #crystals #loveyourself #nature #positivevibes #turnthepage #nextchapterofmylife #quotes #positivity #healthylifestyle #reiki #healing #staystrong #justkeepgoing #mentalhealthawareness #consciousness #gratitude\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Imagine God saying this to you...

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7478474531875704094\nCaption: put in the effort #gym #motivation #fitnessmotivation #workout\nAudio transcript: It's fucking different.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

I never thought those words were gonna be coming out of my mouth, but it's 2024, I guess nothing is impossible. Think about dog food, okay? It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7450555041636814102\nCaption: Never enough#foryou #fy #foryouu #trendingvid #gymlife #gym #gymaddict #viral #viralvideos #gymmotivation #goviral #gymhumor #trendingvideo #gymtok #sad\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: First I wanted abs, now I just hate myself.\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

What do I think about this? All right. 500 testopionate makes perfect sense to me. That's about as where I would max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 milligrams on the high end of the scale. Now, I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at. I go to 600 to 700 mg on the high end of the scale now I am someone that does not aromatize very heavily and that tolerates estrogen very well. if you're a person that tolerates estrogen well testosterone is that base and running running that up up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 mg of Trend E or Trend Ace doesn't really matter, tren is tren. I find that the threshold or side effects become very prevalent in within the six week period of time is 300 mg. Uh really in an off season, 100 mg is the max that I would probably ever take it to. just because the side effects are so prevalent and once you start getting the side effects it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're gonna have to pull the plug eventually. So uh Ace is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects you can pull it out, but 400 mg is where you will side effects in a very short period of time. uh probably within about a four week period of time you're probably gonna get some sleep disruption as well. some emotional anxiety at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not of a really well tolerated number. me personally in all season 100 mg of max I would ever take Tren to. in fact I probably wouldn't even use Tren because side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 mg of Masteron propionate. Now 600 mg of Masteron propionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 mg, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously, high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF-1 production out of that estrogen as you can, as well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails and joints. which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now, on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neuroproductivity. So, protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 or 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masteron for most guys, not all, but most. Now, 75 mg of Androl. Now, I really like Androl. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now, the major issue that I have with Androl is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, and it is reducing down your appetite. Remember that the digestive system in your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the superphysiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Androl is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. It's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. Uh I always tolerate it really well at 50 mg. Anything above there it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. when you think about that. and the side effects were just not worth it. and the water retention was not worth it. including blood pressure. because Androl will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US. and that's for anemia. And if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on the cycle. I personally would have testosterone higher. The tren, if it's off season I probably wouldn't even run it. But 100 mg max, and then the masteron, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well. 75 mg of Androl, I would not go above 50 mg personally. And I'd only do two weeks at a time, if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affects my appetite, and I'll never do it again.\nClassification: Anabolic Steroids\n\nExample 2:\n<video>\nCaption: Date night with my boys #momtok #monsoftiktok #motherhood #icecream #cheatday #datenight\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: PEONY MAY 18 Linden Tree NEW LOCATION 1 Block East From Here 210 N. 10th Alexander's ON THE SQUARE\nClassification: Cheat Meals\n\nExample 3:\n<video>\nCaption: I know its not \"optimal\" to train until failure on every set but its something I enjoy doing and I never like to finish a workout feeling like I couldve of pushed myself harder.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7319257261254331694\nCaption: So Beautiful \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc #fyp #fyp\u30b7 #prettygirls #latinos #love #heartbroken #sadtiktok #lovetiktok\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: When she sounds like this when you look at her \u2728\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

If you're a person that tolerates estrogen well, testosterone is that base and running that up, up until you get estrogenic side effects is what I personally would do. 400 milligrams of TrenE or TrenA doesn't really matter, Tren is Tren. I find that the threshold where side effects become very prevalent in within a six week period of time is 300 milligrams. Really in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max that I would probably ever take it to just because the side effects are so prevalent. And once you start getting the side effects, it goes downhill for the rest of the cycle and you're going to have to pull the plug eventually. So ACE is honestly the route to go just because if you do get side effects, you can pull it out. But 400 milligrams is where you will see side effects in a very short period of time. Probably within about a four week period of time, you're probably going to get some sleep disruption as well as some emotional anxiety, at least to say at the very bare minimum. So not a really well tolerated number. Me personally, in an off season, 100 milligrams is the max I would ever take Tren to. In fact, I probably wouldn't even use Tren because the side effects aren't worth ruining my life. 600 milligrams of Astropropionate. Now 600 milligrams of Astropropionate to a testosterone cypionate at 500 milligrams, that ratio for most guys is going to tank their estrogen levels. If the whole cycle is to try to put on as much muscle tissue as possible, you want as much estrogen as possible and you can tolerate it. Now, obviously high amounts of estrogen for some people will cause some side effects, but you're trying to get as much IGF one production out of that estrogen as you can. As well as estrogen is really good for your hair, skin, nails, and joints, which is one of the only things that you can get that are really good for all those different things. Now on top of that, you also have to talk about neurotransmitters and neural productivity. So protection of the brain and actually things like dopamine and serotonin levels. Estrogen is also phenomenal for that. So if the ratio is going to tank the estrogen levels with a 500 to 600, I personally would not be doing that, especially if someone tolerates the estrogen really well. So usually the testosterone is going to be run above the masterone for most guys. Not all, but most. Now 75 milligrams of Anadrol. Now I really like Anadrol. I know a lot of people talk it down in the bodybuilding space now for whatever reason. It is a DHT derived compound. You do get some water retention with it though. Now the major issue that I have with Anadrol is the histamine response. Most guys are going to have a histamine response in a very short period of time where it's going to reduce down their appetite. So if you're looking for strength, great compound. However, if you're looking to put on as much muscle tissue as possible and it is reducing down your appetite, remember that the digestive system and your appetite is usually going to be the limiting factor to how much muscle tissue you can actually put on during a cycle. Once the super physiological conditions come down, it's how much muscle protein synthesis was able to occur extra from your genetic limitation during that period of time. So if Anadrol is going to be well tolerated by the person, it's going to do well. If it's going to reduce down someone's appetite and blow out the liver, then it's probably not the right compound to add in there. I always tolerate it really well at 50 milligrams, anything above there, it would destroy my appetite and liver. I will say that two weeks at a time is all that I would do it in. Anything above that and the side effects were just not worth it and the water retention was not worth it, including blood pressure because Anadrol will drive up red blood cell count. In fact, that's one of the medical uses for it and it's still FDA approved in the US and that's for anemia and if they need to drive up red blood cell count, it's one of the strongest compounds for doing that. So that is my thoughts on this cycle. I personally would have testosterone sleeping at higher. The trend, if it's off season, I probably wouldn't even run it, but 100 milligrams max and then the masteroon, I would definitely lower that down if I tolerate estrogen well, 75 milligrams of Anadrol, I would not go above 50 milligrams personally and I'd only do two weeks at a time if it's not affecting my appetite. One day randomly, it affected my appetite and I will never do it again.\nEmbedded text: 500mg of Testipina 400 mg of Tren A 600 mg of Masterone 75mg of Androl on training day. what do I think about this. all right 500 test cypionate makes perfect sense to me uh that's about as where I'd max it out at.

And specifically, people want to know if they can use Clomiphene while on a RAD 140 cycle instead of a testosterone base. Before we jump into that, I want to tell you guys that you can get both of these from me at performancelabs.com. It's linked on my page under my bio. And with that being said, I will say this, I do think it makes way more sense for somebody doing that than it does someone using RAD 140 just on its own. The only problem I see with this is that you cannot quit taking the Enclomiphene when you quit taking the RAD 140. If you do that, you're going to have a bad, bad time with natural production of testosterone. And that's why normally Enclomiphene would be used as a PCT after a cycle so that that way it can help stimulate that testosterone production again. So if you are someone considering using Enclomiphene as a base, it is in my opinion that it would probably be in everyone's best interest to continue Enclomiphene after the RAD 140 for at least a month in order to reestablish your natural production. And even with all that being said, you should still just go get on some damn TRT. Helix HRT is also linked in my bio.\nEmbedded text: Enclomiphene Rad-140 Save 10% with code \"TIKTOK10\"\nClassification: Hormone Therapy\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: (OLD) a collection of images that represents an alter, Silver.

So to kick things off, I've been doing GHK copper, 4mg a day, split into two 2mg doses, I've also suspended it in injectable alkanatine for kind of like a double whammy and I've been doing that for about 15 days so far and the reports on it are better than I was expecting. So I knew GHK copper was already good, I've read the literature and so far everything about it is great. There seems to be no negatives to taking it other than the fact that you've got to inject it which for some people is a barrier to entry but not for me. And it's been awesome. My skin quality has gotten really good. I have abused the absolute living hell out of my skin. Don't do anything for it, cold water, bingo, done. No creams, no exfoliation, I work outside, I'm exposed to the elements. I live on the side of the hill so the wind up here is fucking hard and I do off-gridding so no mains, no conventional bits and pieces, harsh elemental stuff and it takes a massive toll on your skin. GHK copper has reversed that quite significantly over the past 15 days. My skin is super soft to the point where my fianc\u00e9e Tiff, she's like, your skin feels different, like touching the chest, touching the face, the back, it's all just a lot smoother and seems to be gaining a lot of elasticity. I also have quite a lot of stretch marks on my hips, around my thighs, a little bit in here between where the pec anchors and a little bit on my bicep and all of those are starting to fade which is really cool and blemishes. Go back to my older videos, look at my face, look at my neck because it was cold but if you look at my face, there is a difference there that I can see and Tiff can see so that's really cool. Other than that, the other major benefit which I'm seeing are joint health. My joints are feeling lubricated, really nice. Again, I work off-grid, I chop my own wood for firewood, I've got animals, all those things can play quite a lot of havoc on your joints. My knees, my elbows, my shoulder joint, I've got a pretty dodgy shoulder. It feels great, absolutely great. I mean, I sound like a right shill for GHK Copper and you know what, fuck it, I am. GHK is awesome, I'm a fanboy, I'm sold, I love it. I am going to continue running this for as long as my finances allow, simple as that really. I'm lucky enough to get the first month for free so that's why I was running this experiment and yeah, I will continue running this out of my own pocket. Now, the next thing I need to talk about is my pre-workout because I don't talk about it enough. You guys already know, I formulated my own pre-workout. The link is in my bio. So far, there's not a single negative review about the efficiency of this pre-workout. The Review Bros reviewed it, they gave it 9.5 out of 10, a must-try pre-workout for a daily driver. You won't get a crash from taking this, you will get insane pump, you will get insane focus, you will get insane drive. It's kind of as simple as that. The dosing on this is basically one scoop is 100mg of caffeine. So you can titrate that up and down as much as you like. Technically, there are 64 scoops but realistically, there's about just under 66. Call it 65. I personally like the 2-3 scoop mark. Some people have 4 scoops, some people have 1 scoop. It all depends on your tolerance or caffeine as well as the other ingredients in here. I have dopaminergics, serotonergics and cholinergics. Those three things are all neurotransmitter precursors which will help you get locked in and driven. There's also some hella pump ingredients here with a shit-ton of pure citrulline, arginine, pine bark extract, methylated donors such as biotin and hydrous. It's just a good pre-workout. I don't need to sit here and talk about the science because I don't think any of you particularly care about the inner workings of how this stuff works. Maybe you do, maybe I'm wrong but it's kind of fully loaded and if I can get more of these units sold, I can make a caffeine-free version which I know some of you are really wanting and also some new flavour profiles. There's been some random, not random, there's been some banded about like lemon and lime or say a blue raspberry, a forest fruit style thing, orange has been one of them. I'm not sure what flavour to go for next and I can't afford it right now. Being blunt, I can't afford it but when I can, I will deliver. My end goal with this whole supplement line is to have a one-stop shop for basically steroid cycle support and gym performance. Obviously if you're natural, pre-workout is absolutely fine but if you're enhanced, I want to make a kidney support, liver support, endothelial lining support for your arteries, cardiovascular support for your heart, that kind of thing. So far I have like Amazon lists, again link in my bio, where I go, hey if you're taking Klen, you should probably look into these supplements. If you're doing a steroid cycle, you should look into these supplements. I do have that but ideally I'd have like an all-in-one where you go and take four of these pills a day, spread out and you're kind of golden. Well at least you're not golden because you're taking PEDS right? But at least you are covering your bases, that's my goal, that's where I want to be. Not there yet, obviously I can't even afford a second run of the pre-workout but when I can. Again, the reviews are stellar. If I can keep getting exposure under the pre-workout so I can get returning customers, people who want the product, people who want me to develop more products, then I can build my range. But for now, I'm going at it alone. A lot of the big players within the supplement industry don't like me. No one's reached out to me directly and said hey bro, you're kind of doing this wrong, that's why we're not a fan of you. It's more like I go to reach out to them and I'm blocked. No communication, just blocked. And I can only read one thing into that and all I can read into it is that my pre-workout, my supplement line is a threat to what they're trying to do in their margins. Which is fair enough, if I'm coming in here and trying to undercut based on the dosing and the price, then yeah, fair enough. I guess that's business for you, right? Cutthroat. But yeah, let that speak for itself, right? So if you're interested, help me out. The link is in the bio. There are plenty of codes banding around which you can use to get a small discount. Absolutely fine, I don't mind. I just appreciate the support. Yeah, I think that's about it for this video. That's a six, seven minute video. God, I keep rambling. I should just make YouTube. If I can make these long form videos, I should just go to YouTube. Either way, if you enjoyed this, drop a like, drop a comment, favorite, follow, all that kind of governs. And just like with the previous video, if you made it all the way to seven minute mark and you haven't bought my pre-workout yet but are interested, shoot me a DM on Instagram and I'll give you a specialized discount code for you. An easter egg if you are interested. That's it for this one. Thank you for watching.

It's the same thing every single day, no variables, it doesn't take a lot of prep, it's just the same thing every single day. That is exactly how a majority of bodybuilders eat right now, so it makes sense why dog food would become a thing for humans soon. Introducing dog food, literally D-A-W-G, dog food. Their entire brand is being dog food for humans, even their packaging, their ingredient list, everything looks like actual dog food, like it looks real. There's two versions, a chicken and a beef one. So each serving is about 322 calories, 16 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs, and 45 grams of protein for this. The chicken and the beef version both come unseasoned, so you do have to cook it yourself, you can season it however you want. This does come in at $58.99, but there's 14 meals inside of this bag, so it's actually less than $5 per meal. That is scary cheap, I mean, no way you're gonna find 45 grams of protein for less than $5 anywhere else. I definitely won't be trying this, but it's a pretty cool concept, I'm not gonna lie, this is kinda cool.\nEmbedded text: DOG FOOD FOR HUMANS FOOD HUMANS MY 2024 IMPOSSIBLE FOOD THING TAKE EVERY EXACTLY OF RIGHT SENSE HUMAN INTRODUCING DAWG FOOD LITERALLY DAWG FOOD DAWG FOOD FOR BEING HUMANS THEIR ACTUAL LIKE VERSIONS CHICKEN BEEF 90/10 CARROTS SWEET POTATO GREEN BEANS PEAS SWEET CORN FOOD SO 322 16 10 CARBS 45 PROTEIN CHICKEN BOTH UNSEASONED COOK SEASON WANT AT DOLLARS CENTS 14 ACTUALLY $5 CHEAP 45 GRAMS THAN ANYWHERE GONNA PRETTY GONNA\nClassification: Unsafe Food\n\nNow analyze this video and classify it:\n\n<video>\nVIDEO_ID: 7479961493996358943\nCaption: Everything you want in life is at the gym.\nAudio transcript: people addicted to the gym are smex addicts you can't prove me wrong well i can't do that because you're actually right being in the gym consistently is going to increase testosterone which is critical for libido in both men and women it is also going to increase blood flow reduce stress increase endorphins and enhance self-esteem which is all critical for doing the sideways tango ultimately another reason why i say that you will find everything that you want in life at the gym god bless y'all have a great day\nEmbedded text: Lord of Cinema X Al @TheXFilmXLord Ppl addicted to the gym are sex addicts.

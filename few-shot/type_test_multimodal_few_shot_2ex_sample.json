Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

To find out, I've set up an experiment. Brandon will train naturally using my science-backed strategy. Hit the head, hit the head. While Todd is hopping on steroids. For the next 100 days, we'll track their progress to see who comes out on top. Holy shit, dude. First, we need starting points. And to get the best data possible, we're not only using DEXA scans to measure overall fat and muscle mass, but we're also getting ultrasounds across all major muscle groups to know exactly where each person experiences the most growth. So on day one, Todd is coming in at 183 pounds and 19% body fat, while Brandon weighs only 148 pounds, but scores a lean 13.6% body fat. Now compared to Todd, we actually have two major advantages. First off, Brandon is lean, which means we can focus on gaining weight to maximize growth. Whereas Todd, an aspiring bodybuilder, will soon begin dieting down for his competition. Second, while Brandon isn't a complete beginner, he's not as serious of a lifter as Todd. In normal circumstances, this means Todd would build muscle about three times slower than Brandon, but these aren't normal circumstances. And I'll need to use every science-based tool I know to help Brandon supercharge his training. So once steroids make their way into your muscle cells, they bind to a powerful androgen receptor. Once bound, they alter your muscle's genetics to dramatically increase the rates of protein synthesis and recovery. So although it pushed Brandon's workout volume and intensity to his natural limit. Let's go up. It's feeling kind of heavy today. Not only does every workout Todd do now lead to more muscle growth, but he can also train longer and harder than Brandon, yet still be able to recover from it. But how much of a difference will this all make after a hundred days? Well, based on prior research, beginner natural lifters can expect to put on about 3.7 pounds of muscle after a hundred days of hard training. Enhanced lifters, however, gain muscle about three times faster, resulting in over 13 pounds of muscle gain within a similar time period. For supplements, although Todd has his special juice assisting him, we've got a natural supplement we'll be taking full advantage of, and one that could give us as much as a one to two pound boost of muscle, creatine. Doesn't sound like much, but considering Brandon's a natural and has some experience in the gym, we may only gain just two to three pounds of muscle in the next hundred days. So even just a one pound boost would be huge. I haven't seen you in two months. Hey, you look good though, man. He's quiet, he's just getting mentally ready for this. I'm pretty nervous right now. But while Brandon was completing his scan, I was finding out just how hard Todd had been working since we last spoke. Cardio is like 65 minutes per day, and I still have to train. So yeah, I'm tired. Oh my God, oh my God. I'm honestly in disbelief. So, results are in. Brandon, your starting body fat was 13.6%. Today, it's at 13.5%, which means your body fat pretty much stayed the same. Your starting weight was 149 pounds. Today, it's 154 pounds, which means you gained five pounds, pure muscle, lean muscle. Let's go. But Todd, on the other hand, you started at 19% body fat. Today, you're at 7% body fat, which means you lost over 10 pounds in weight, and you gained over 13 pounds of muscle, which is insane. Holy. I'm gonna be honest, I knew there would be a difference. And Todd had a big advantage, but I didn't think it was gonna be like this.\nEmbedded text: DO NATURAL LIFTERS REALLY STAND A CHANCE?

A mathematical model of the effects of resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy on body composition Marcella Torres'. Eric T. Trexler2 . Abbie E. Smith-Ryan', Angela Reynolds' Received: 14 June 2017/ Accepted: 5 December 2017/ Published online: 18 December 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2017 Abstract Purpose Current diet and exercise methods used to maintain or improve body composition often have poor long-term outcomes. We hypothesize that resistance exercise (RE) alone will result in minimal changes in fat mass (FM) and positive changes in lean mass (LM) and metabolic rate. Method We applied our previously developed energy balance model of human metabolism to include muscle hypertrophy in response to RE. We hard fit model parameters to a hypothetical individual to simulate an RE program and then compared changes in body mass and fat-free mass from diet and exercise alone (conventional exercise (CE)) to RE. We then simulated a cohort of individuals with different responses to RE by varying the parameters controlling it using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The human model of energy and body composition changes (HOMMEC) was modified Conclusion The model is able to reproduce the time course of change in LM in response to RE and can be used to generate a simulated cohort for in silico clinical studies. Simulations suggest that the additional LM generated by RE may shift the OVER 100 DAYS BASED ON PRIOR RESEARCH BEGINNER NATURAL BEGINNER NATURAL 3.7 lb MUSCLE GROWTH 100 DAYS NATURAL LIFTERS CAN EXPECT TO PUT ON ABOUT 3.7 POUNDS OF MUSCLE AFTER 100 DAYS OF HARD TRAINING ENHANCED ENHANCED 3x FASTER 3.7 lb MUSCLE GROWTH 100 DAYS ENHANCED LIFTERS HOWEVER GAIN MUSCLE ABOUT THREE TIMES FASTER RESULTING IN OVER 13 POUNDS OF MUSCLE GAIN WITHIN A SIMILAR TIME PERIOD FOR SUPPLEMENTS ALTHOUGH TODD HAS HIS SPECIAL JUICE ASSISTING HIM WE'VE GOT A NATURAL SUPPLEMENT WE'LL BE TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF AND ONE THAT COULD GIVE US AS MUCH AS A 1 TO 2 POUND BOOST OF MUSCLE CREATINE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT CONSIDERING BRANDON NATURAL LIFTER GYM EXPERIENCE AS A NATURAL AND HAS SOME GYM EXPERIENCE WE MAY ONLY GAIN JUST 2 TO 3 POUNDS OF MUSCLE IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS SO EVEN JUST A 1 POUND BOOST WOULD BE HUGE FINAL DAY I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN TWO MONTHS dang, you look good though, man HE'S QUIET, HE'S JUST GETTING MENTALLY READY FOR THIS I'M PRETTY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW BUT WHILE BRANDON WAS COMPLETING HIS SCAN I WAS FINDING OUT JUST HOW HARD TODD HAD BEEN WORKING SINCE WE LAST SPOKE Cardio is like 65 minutes per day SO YEAH TIRED OH MY GOD...

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone?

Jun 23, 2023 Can vitamin D lower SHBG? This finding suggests that vitamin D supplementation may have a stabilizing effect on SHBG levels in individuals with lower vitamin D status, indicating a potential role of vitamin D in regulating the availability of sex hormones in the body.

You want to like extend how many, how much gains you can get as a natural because you don't want to put on muscle taking steroids that you could put on naturally. Like that just sounds fucking stupid. Then you're gonna have to take more steroids later on in your lifting career to get more gains. So you're kind of like, it's, you're compensating. Stay natural. Stay natural.\nEmbedded text: TREN TWINS CYCLE + 100 mg of tren a week\nClassification: Supplement Abuse\n\nExample 12:\n<video>\nCaption: How to boost testosterone naturally [Just take these 3 vitamins] #boosttestosterone #boosttestosteronenaturally #testosteronebooster #trt #testosteronetherapy\nAudio transcript: Three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally. These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone? Boosted Testosterone Levels While research on the direct effects of fish oil on testosterone levels is limited, some studies have shown that omega-3 supplementation may have a positive impact on testosterone production and regulation, improving the health of the testicle. Jun 23, 2023 Can vitamin D lower SHBG? This finding suggests that vitamin D supplementation may have a stabilizing effect on SHBG levels in individuals with lower vitamin D status, indicating a potential role of vitamin D in regulating the availability of sex hormones in the body.

All steroids do is increase nitrogen retention. They allow you to recover faster so you can train more, but they don't actually build the muscle. The training's a stimulus, and the food is what's used to construct and build muscle. You need calories, obviously, and protein. Steroids also gives you kind of a lower minimum effective volume and a greater maximum recoverable volumes. You can be a little fast and loose and still get results. They certainly work. More of them isn't gonna build more muscle, but eating more food and optimizing hypertrophy training is certainly the way to do it. Steroids just help facilitate that. That's key, yeah. I mean, they can't synthesize muscle tissue from air. Muscle tissue is protein structures. Your body is made up of food. You could take all the gear in the world. If you don't supply it with food and training, the gear is gonna make sure that any food you do eat is more likely to be synthesized as muscle proteins, but you still have to eat it, and you still have to create the stimulus in the gym.\nEmbedded text: ST*ROIDS DON'T BUILD MUSCLE ALL ST*ROIDS DO IS INCREASE NITROGEN RETENTION THEY ALLOW YOU TO RECOVER FASTER SO YOU CAN TRAIN MORE BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY BUILD THE MUSCLE THE TRAINING'S THE STIMULUS THE FOOD'S WHAT'S USED TO CONSTRUCT MUSCLE YOU NEED CALORIES ST*ROIDS ALSO GIVES YOU KIND OF A LOWER MINIMUM EFFECTIVE VOLUME AND A GREATER MAXIMUM RECOVERABLE VOLUME SO YOU CAN BE A LITTLE FAST AND LOOSE AND STILL GET RESULTS THEY CERTAINLY WORK MORE OF THEM ISN'T GOING TO EATING MORE FOOD OPTIMIZING YOUR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING IS CERTAINLY THE WAY TO DO IT ST*ROIDS JUST HELP FACILITATE THAT THAT'S KEY THEY CAN'T SYNTHESIZE MUSCLE TISSUE Hypertrophy occurs when Muscle Synthesis > Muscle Breakdown FROM AIR PROTEIN STRUCTURE YOUR BODY IS MADE UP OF FOOD ALL THE GEAR IN THE WORLD IF YOU DON'T SUPPLY IT WITH FOOD TRAINING THE GEAR IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY FOOD YOU DO EAT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE SYNTHESIZED AS MUSCLE PROTEINS BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO EAT IT YOU STILL HAVE TO CREATE THE STIMULUS IN THE GYM\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.

Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Let's see the update. So here you go. This is officially one year on TRT therapy I started out at three hundred and twelve pounds point two ounces today I weighed in at two seventy four point four now if you've watched some of the other videos You're gonna say hey you were down in the two sixties. What the heck happened? Well, obviously when I got injured with my finger, I couldn't lift weights All I could do was cardio and then I got busy things like that So realistically, I'm gonna wait till like week 55 week 56 and see where I am I've got to clean my diet up a little bit just because I've been a fat ass being flat-out honest So you don't want to gain a bunch of weight don't do that But before we go any further, let me get out of this old tea and get back into the new one But I just wanted to have it on to show the difference like this is where we are Today like boop, you know arm looks nice everything like that. You know shoulder look good. Yeah, that's just Old t-shirt doesn't fit as well because it's it's literally huge. Like it's crazy to think like I Didn't fill that out, but I filled it out a lot more than I am right now so let me switch out of this and get into my black shirt because yeah, that's just It's not complimentary at all There we go This is much better much better fitting and you can see more definition of my arms and everything like that Look at that. That is all that tricep Vascularity is coming in nice the arm looks good. I'm just Mmm, so excited because if you've been following like I said last time I'm only on like I went through five mls of TRT right now because I was on some bad TRT Which if you watch a lot of videos and you see people commenting like oh buy it for me buy it for me Don't do that. Nope. Don't go buy it from somebody's comments and shit like that Do your research find out what lab they're coming from and then you won't have any problems So let's go right arm Not bad, not bad So as far as everything goes this week, it's 274.4 is the weigh-in I did get some cardio in I didn't get much working out But it was a busy week sadly So that's where we kind of are. So a couple things that I want to touch on from the first video bald spot TRT creates bald spots, but I think I posted a video this of what my bald spot looks like and Let's just take a quick little gander It's kind of filled in and I attribute that To this stuff right here. You want to get some nioxin? Get this they have a shampoo shit kit Whatever you want to call it Put that in after you wash your hair and do it There's two-part system when you do shower and your hair stays in that's good and actually mine is going back. So that's even better Now the other things with TRT I get a lot of comments of how's my blood work? How's my blood work? It's been great I haven't had any issues with my HH levels I did have some estrogen spikes at some point and I had too much pregnenolone at some point as well But I think for the first year a lot of trials and tribulations have worked out good you know here try this try that fix this fix that and now I should be on a progression of Increasing goodness of everything because I feel energized. I mean granted I had some injuries along the way I got tennis elbow and this tendonitis in this left arm and elbow I got back and hip pain which prevents me from running and standing for long and Just just general man. I got this cut. I'm like, come on like I just want to do Activities and become a healthier person because my entire life I've been fat at some point some point I was up to like 350 something like that I had gotten down to 258 was my lowest ever but at the same time I was always missing something and TRT happened to be that that gap filler if you will if 10 15 20 years ago when I was in my teens the TRT was even a thing I would hopped on that immediately because there was Your life would have just totally been different. I'm standing here to you today as a 37 year old man going Wow, I am if you watch the first video to now like it's like a totally different person and right now I'm actually like bloated because I already ate today and like I'm a little puffy didn't sleep good But hey, you got to get the video content out because you guys want it So, yeah, if you have any questions drop them down below I probably will make a part two to this video to go in the more in-depth of how I feel and how I felt this Past year and answer many random questions you might have but I will tell you right now TRT has changed my life in a positive aspect I would never go off of it and I would say dude if I can ride this out to the day I die I am perfectly cool with that because you just feel better. I can't express that enough Had tons of messages and people friends family non friends weirdos on the internet say how do you feel? Do you really feel difference? I'm so scared to join it and good on it Hey, you know what? I was the same way and that was kind of the reason I made this video Because well, I shouldn't say video this video series is because there's so much weird information on the internet A lot of its spam bots a lot of its bodybuilders a lot of it's just fat guys They don't know how to change their life, but they're like, oh my god I'm on the verge of suicide because I feel like crap If you need someone to talk to by all means call that person call me whatever I will come back and help you out if I can but for now, I will tell you don't be scared Just find the right clinic for you, and you should be good. I have a good clinic. It's steel city Men's clinic in Pittsburgh. I might be switching eventually, but for right now, they've been doing me good and I can't complain So yeah drop your questions comments down below part two coming next couple days and let's see what happens in the next few weeks because I'm gonna keep doing this series because It's neat to see I didn't think I would have the changes that I did I thought I'd actually have more to a degree but at the same time I'm like shit if this is to 75 essentially and I've only dropped like 33 and a half pounds Yeah, if I dropped like 50 pounds, I'm gonna be a brick shithouse and I'm okay with that.

Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Probably not worth it. I want a steak that's nice and red all the way through. No brown spots. Like I said, this doesn't mean it's bad. It doesn't mean it's rotten. Smells fine. I could probably eat this and be okay, but in order to keep my chances low and go on a smooth win streak, I'm not doing this.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is.

Testosterone is very important with our sex drive and making sure that we are sexually interested. So if you're noticing changes in your desire for sex or if you're not feeling as though your libido is as high as it used to be, you may be experiencing symptoms of low testosterone. If you're unsure how to proceed or determine if you have low testosterone, talk to your primary care doctor. Give them a call, schedule an appointment so they can determine whether or not a testosterone test would be appropriate for you. If you do not have a primary doctor or if you're looking to get tested for low testosterone right away, reach out to us at Hendrix Health.

Let's get into it. This is part two of the daddy wellness manual. We already went over nutrition. We already went over training. Now let's get into the mental game and the social life and strategic parting. First things first, and it's the biggest challenge you are going to face. It's the mental fucking game and this is how you are going to beat it. Hunger equals progress. You need to tell yourself that every time you are hungry because if you're not experiencing periods of hunger throughout the day, you're probably not gonna get those abs you fucking want. Next is mindful eating and getting the fuck off your phone throughout your meals. Appreciate the food you are eating, disconnect and enjoy every bite because you will experience periods of discomfort throughout the first and second month from eating less than you typically do. Next is writing down your fucking goals. This will trigger the fucking mind to be more focused to help you get to where you wanna fucking be. Next is avoiding short-term dopamine hits from junk food. It only takes three fucking seconds to shove a chocolate chip down your fucking gullet. It's better if you eat the fucking chicken and stay the fuck away from the trash. Lastly is telling yourself and enjoy the short-term pain for the long-term fucking joy. And last but not least, the social life and party because we can still make fucking gains while enjoying ourselves if we have balance and a strategic approach. You wanna eat less food on the days that you know you're gonna party fucking hard and you will get more of a buzz, you will spend less money. It's a win fucking win. You wanna stick to low calorie cocktails and seltzers. I'm a straight tech soda lime type of guy. It gives me the least hangover and it tastes fucking fantastic and you were absolutely blitzed after three or four on less of an empty fucking stomach. Next is slamming water before you send and leaving a large cup of water next to your nightstand with a little African shaggy to help you go me mead. This will help you not get as fucking hungover. Next is stocking up on healthy fire late night munchies so you can still crank a little one too when you get back and enjoy a snack with your boys.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone?

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

Famous for being the founding father of a tribe that promotes returning to a lifestyle more similar to that of our ancestors, he carries out routines totally out of the ordinary. One of those principles is exercise. For the king of the liver, this is mandatory every day, three times a day. The famous 45 years, he says that he has had this lifestyle for two decades as a result of the constant allergies and diseases that his children suffered. In fact, he describes it as the most difficult day of his life, an occasion when he almost loses one of his children due to a serious allergy episode.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone?

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3.

There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone.

Doing all these crunches and sit-ups that influencers tell you you're gonna blast fat away won't fucking work. Here's what you need to do. So our body has two different types of fat. Subcutaneous fat, also known as outside fat that you can see, and visceral fat or inside fat that's around your organs. We don't want much of either. So to lose the outside fat, we have to lower your body fat percentage. And this is done with, you guessed it, a calorie deficit and lifting weights to speed up your metabolism. Now for inside fat, get your ass doing some cardio. In a perfect world, you're in a calorie deficit, lifting weights and doing 30 minutes of cardio after your workouts. And it's pretty easy to be in that perfect world if you ask me. If you wanna flatten your stomach the right way, follow me.\nEmbedded text: STOP TRYING TO GET A FLAT STOMACH YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S NO SECRET F*CKING AB EXERCISE THAT'S GONNA GET YOU A FLAT STOMACH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SPOT REDUCE FAT DOING ALL THESE CRUNCHES AND SIT UPS THAT INFLUENCERS TELL YOU'RE GONNA BLAST FAT AWAY WON'T F*CKING WORK HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO OUR BODY HAS 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT ALSO KNOWN AS OUTSIDE FAT AND VISCERAL FAT OR INSIDE FAT THAT'S AROUND YOUR ORGANS WE DON'T WANT MUCH OF EITHER SO TO LOSE THE OUTSIDE FAT WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIS IS DONE WITH YOU GUESSED IT A CALORIE DEFICIT AND LIFTING WEIGHTS TO SPEED UP YOUR METABOLISM NOW FOR INSIDE FAT GET YOUR ASS DOING SOME CARDIO IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU'RE IN A CALORIE DEFICIT LIFTING WEIGHTS AND DOING 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AFTER YOUR WORKOUTS AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO BE IN THAT PERFECT WORLD IF YOU ASK ME IF YOU WANNA FLATTEN YOUR STOMACH THE RIGHT WAY FOLLOW\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 4:\n<video>\nCaption: still got allot of work to do #roadto200LBS - - - - - - #fyp #skinny #tall #transformation #hardwork #discipline #motivation #MentalHealth #gym #gymtok #mentality\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 6'3 105lbs 2022 6'5 170LBS 2025\nClassification: Relationship to Body\n\nExample 5:\n<video>\nCaption: In all seriousness, exercise is a great form of therapy #drinkiconic #iconicprotein #beiconic #dupe#dupes#therapydupe#therapydupetrend#lol#trending#relatable#gymthings#exercising#exercisethings#exercisetok#gymtok#workouttok#therapytok#therapytiktok#proteinpowder#protrinshake#proteinshakes#getyourstepsin#closeyourrings#applewatchlife#applewatch#applewatchhacks#applewatchlifestyle#workouttherapy#gymtherapy#gymtherapyisthebesttherapy#\nAudio transcript: therapy dupe oh my god a therapy dupe\nEmbedded text: POV: someone told you exercise is a dupe for therapy\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 6:\n<video>\nCaption: train harder #fyp #weightlifting #bodybuilding\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: No text overlaid on screen.\nClassification: Relationship to Exercise\n\nExample 7:\n<video>\nCaption: Food is always , never disappointed with the quality or the service! #goodfood #Orlando #Mexicanfood #birratacos #queso #quesadilla #cheatday #goodvibes\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @rvablack\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 8:\n<video>\nCaption: TOP 1 womans physique no @Arnold Sports South America 2025 me acompanhe no ig: llivia_fit ACBUM @Dark Lab @Berzerk #fyp #viralvideos #gym #bodybuilding #atleta #fisiculturismo\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: 1 semana 5 dias 3 dias carb up come\u00e7ou algumas horas (cansada top-1 woman's physique\nClassification: Relationship to Food\n\nExample 9:\n<video>\nCaption: Okay bud #CapCut #gym #review #preworkout #summer #fyp #jim\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: Just rowing your boyfriends max squat Sit down lil boy\ud83d\ude08\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 10:\n<video>\nCaption: Make a man out of you! . . . #gymmotivation #gymlife #gymrat #gymbro #gymtoks #fitness #fyp #fitnessmotivation #fitnesstips #fitnessjourney #workoutroutine #workoutmotivation #fypviral #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp\nAudio transcript: N/A\nEmbedded text: @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890 @kevinp9890\nClassification: Relationship to Masculinity\n\nExample 11:\n<video>\nCaption: Tren Twins explain their current gear cycle #trentwins #tren #bodybuilding #fyp #viral #fitnessmotivation #legendsofaesthetics #motivation\nAudio transcript: we're on fucking, you know, 210 milligrams of test, 20 milligrams of Anivar, two IUs of growth.

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone? Boosted Testosterone Levels While research on the direct effects of fish oil on testosterone levels is limited, some studies have shown that omega-3 supplementation may have a positive impact on testosterone production and regulation, improving the health of the testicle. Jun 23, 2023 Can vitamin D lower SHBG? This finding suggests that vitamin D supplementation may have a stabilizing effect on SHBG levels in individuals with lower vitamin D status, indicating a potential role of vitamin D in regulating the availability of sex hormones in the body.

JCEM 1981 Zn is located primarily in the Leydig cells, the late type B spermatogonia, and the spermatids. Zn is essential for the production and secretion of testosterone from the Leydig cells (15, 16), which, in conjunction with follicle stimulating hormone, is a key regulator of spermatogenesis (17). Jan 19, 2011 Does zinc help you get harder? Share on Pinterest Zinc supplements may be used as a potential treatment for ED. Zinc helps produce key sex hormones, such as testosterone and prolactin. Zinc also enables the creation of the main component of prostatic fluid. There is evidence that dietary zinc may impact male sexual competency. ...

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT. If this video helped you out, smash the like button and I'll see you in the next video.\nEmbedded text: 3 SUPPLEMENTS THAT BOOST TESTOSTERONE NATURALLY Can omega-3 increase testosterone?

These will also help you if you're on TRT to help maximize the benefits. The first one is omega-3 fatty acids. This is gonna help with your heart health, your brain health, and your immune system, which are all things that are vital building blocks to high testosterone. Second supplement is vitamin D3. This is huge for freeing up more testosterone in your body. There are studies that show that vitamin D3 lowers sex hormone binding globulin, which allows more of your total testosterone to convert to usable testosterone. So this is huge if you're looking to boost your testosterone naturally or you're on TRT and want to maximize the benefits. The last and my favorite supplement is zinc and magnesium. Zinc and magnesium work together, and what they do is they support the function of the lydic cells to produce more testosterone. And one added benefit that I can definitely notice is the quality and the hardness of the little man downstairs. So there it is. Those are the top three supplements to help boost your testosterone naturally or to help you see the full benefits from your TRT.

A regular cut is going to put you at a 300 to 600 calorie deficit, but an aggressive cut is going to put you in a much higher deficit, so 1,000, maybe 1,000 plus calories. Because you are in such a big deficit, you don't want to do that for more than six to eight weeks because you're going to eventually start to lose muscle if you stay in an aggressive cut too long. You want to make sure you're getting sleep. You want to make sure you're eating enough fats. You need a minimum amount of fats for proper hormone, testosterone production, et cetera. And then protein, keep your protein high, one gram per pound you weigh or more. If you can get more, that's even better. And then don't change your workouts. Keep your workouts like they were when you were bulking. Keep lifting heavy.

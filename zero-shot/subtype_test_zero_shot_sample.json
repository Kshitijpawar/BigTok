Getting shredded is very difficult so sticking to food you like that are filling are very important. After many years of dieting ive found some great options such as greek yogurt, chicken salad, low calorie popcorn, tuna and vegetables. Check out my full day of eating and follow me for more tips on losing weight. #weightloss #whatieatinaday #whatieat #fulldayofeating\nAudio transcript: This is everything I eat in a day to shred down and look like a Greek fucking god, so let's get into it. I'm obviously not a big fan of eating at 2100 calories, especially when I'm 225 pounds, but I got a shoot coming up in the middle of July, and I need to get nice and lean for it, so it is what it is. You know I'm starting the day off with some Yo Jam, 300 calories, 36 grams of protein. What's better than that? Maybe some French toast, but we're on the cut, so get fucked, that's not happening. Next up we have this chicken salad with fat-free Italian dressing, tasted amazing. This is how I open bananas, by the way, my nonna taught me how to do that. I've never seen anyone else do it that way besides monkeys, I guess that makes sense because I'm fucking stupid. For dinner I had tuna steak and these vegetables that look like they could have been served to you in prison. Um... Anyways, I ended up at McDonald's on an ice cream date with your mother, great time, we got vanilla cones, I actually love these guys, the machine was working, it was green lights all night, and then I got into a couple bags of popcorn, and that was it guys, 2100 calories.\nEmbedded text: N/A\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

Now there's a few different reasons and it also depends on what the actual steroid you're using is. So let's say for someone who's either bulking or just on TRT, they would wanna have stable levels of testosterone. You generally know how you're going to respond to testosterone. It's not a foreign substance to your body and not gonna have crazy side effects compared to like Tren, for example. So if you're bulking or you're on TRT, you'd wanna have a longer-acting ester to keep your levels more stable because if it takes longer to absorb, it's going to have a slower peak and therefore a slower value. And therefore with more frequent injections, you're also able to keep those levels more stable. Versus if you were to take Test-Propionate or Trenacetate or Nandrolone Phenylpropionate, these have shorter esters, meaning they absorb quicker, so you're gonna get a bigger spike in the compound when you start taking it, which could come along with more side effects. However, with more toxic compounds like Tren or Nandrolone, this would still be a benefit because it comes out quicker. Rather than you noticing the side effects after you've been taking it for a week and then you stop taking it, it's still in your system because it's a long-acting ester. Then you're gonna have to deal with those side effects for even longer. Versus with a short-acting ester like MPP or Trenace, if you start noticing those side effects, you can take the dosage down really quickly. Then another benefit to using a short-acting ester like Test-Propionate would be at the end of a contest prep where you'd want to be able to take the testosterone out really quickly, such as if you were one to two weeks out of a show. You'd have more control over your testosterone and estradiol levels. Or if you need to make changes really quickly, such as decreasing your dosage from 500 to 400 to 300. You can have more control and make those changes quicker at the end of a contest prep. But if you know how you're gonna respond to the compound and you're not at the end of a contest prep, I would generally go with longer-acting esters because also you're going to want to be on these compounds for a good amount of time. You don't build muscle in just a six-week cycle or an eight-week cycle. So taking a long-acting ester will allow you to stay on that cycle for longer with more stable levels, therefore less side effects, therefore allowing you to make more long-term gains.\nEmbedded text: THOUGHTS: I need to extract all text that appears as an overlay on the video frames.

Bro your info is amazing Acetate vs Tren Enanthate Tren Acetate vs Tren Enanthate different reasons, the actual steroid bulking they would want to have Compound Concentration Estimate stable levels how you're going to respond It's not Foreign substance Cell A Specific proteins Cell B produces foreign substance to your body crazy compared to like tren, So if you're bulking you'd want to have a longer Compound Concentration Estimate because if it takes longer to absorb, it's going to have a slower peak slower valley. frequent injections, you're also able to keep more stable versus propionate or tren acetate Steroid esters: Drug Formate Acetate Propionate Phenylpropionate Butyrate Valerate Hexanoate Corsoate Heptanoate Brominate Octanoate Cypionate Decanoate Undecanoate Active half-life 1.5 days 3 days 4.5 days 4.5 days 6.5 days 7.5 days 9 days 9 days 10.5 days 10.5 days 12 days 12 days 16 days 16.5 days or nandrolone phenylpropionate (NPP) These have shorter esters, Compound Concentration Estimate they absorb quicker. a bigger spike which could come along However, more toxic compounds like tren this would still be a benefit Compound Concentration Estimate because it comes out noticing the side effects Compound Concentration Estimate then you stop taking it. It's still in your system for even longer versus ester like NPP or tren ace the side effects, STEROLD USE you can take really quickly. Then another benefit to ester like test propionate would be at the end such as if you were you'd have more control over your testosterone and estradiol levels to make changes such as decreasing you can have more control at the end of a how you're going and you're not at the end I would generally go Boldenone Undecaenoate 250 mg/mL Nandrolone Decanoate 200 mg/mL because also to be on these compounds You don't build muscle in just a six week So taking a long acting to stay on that cycle with more stable levels, therefore less side allowing you to make more long term gains.\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

Here's what we're having. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we're having liver. We've got about three or four ounces of liver. Liver, one of its other names is nature's multivitamin because there are a lot of minerals and vitamins found in the liver. There's high amounts of, I believe, vitamin A in liver. Vitamin A is one of the fat-soluble vitamins, D-E-K-A, and fat-soluble vitamins are not ones that can be excreted in your urine and can actually be stored in your fat stores, which means that it's very easy to overdo it with vitamin A, especially with the huge amounts that are found in liver. The Liver King concoction. I wanna know what's in the Liver King concoction. We're having a couple of patties today. I hope he's not eating all those patties. That's a lot, a lot of meat. All these patties are for me. Some of you guys think I don't eat all this food. I eat every single patty. I eat every single fry. That's a lot of food. Caloric intake has gotta be huge. I don't know how much exercise he's doing. It's probably a lot. I also don't know if he's supplementing with any kind of exogenous hormones, not making any presumptions here, but it's possible, especially when you're eating huge amounts like this. It's very, very interesting. That's a good exercise. My man is not only doing a farmer's walk with heavy kettlebells, but he's doing it in the water with added water resistance. Good, good exercise. We have a hard shell hyperbaric chamber. We pump in pure medical grade O2. This is really interesting, because based on zoning laws and how these things can explode, only certified facilities like hospitals and places where you have to have a certain distance away from other commercial facilities and residential facilities, I believe, that you're allowed to have one of these. When it comes to hyperbaric treatments, though, there's a lot of misinformation out there of people claiming that it cures everything from cancer to Lyme disease to Alzheimer's disease, which is complete poo-poo. It's never been proven to do any of those things. In fact, here's a list of the things that it's actually been proven to help with and we use in our hospitals every single day. We have our cold plums. There's pine needles in here. There's leaves in here. There's stuff in here that you'd probably say you should probably clean your cold plunge, but this is all earth. This is all stuff that's gonna help. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with having leaves in your cold plunge. That's not a problem. Like, if you have a dead raccoon in there that's rotting away, maybe you wanna get that bad boy out. The Barbarian. \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a That's a savage amount of weight to be carrying around. He's really strong. I warn people away from doing this. It's very easy to see someone do this and say, okay, I'm gonna strap on all this stuff, maybe go lighter. But please do it gradually. Please do it slowly. Even if you've done heavyweight before, do not return to the same weight that you've been doing if you haven't been exercising. It's the surefire way to cause an injury and stay out of exercising for several weeks, if not months.\nEmbedded text: - Liver king here.

You're starving yourself? What are you doing? Just eat bro. And then the guy is you know well let's just say out of shape. Dieting wise you've really got one factor which is gonna make or break it and that's if you're in a calorie deficit. If you want steady fat loss results then you do have to fucking make sure every calorie is accounted for. Like you could do everything. Track your calories. Eat in certain times of the day but if you're not like completely anal about every calorie you can kind of screw yourself. Less energy than you're gonna burn throughout the whole day. So your body still needs that extra energy. It's still got to run itself. Where's it gonna go? It's got no food so it's either gonna tell your brain okay go eat something right now or you can tough out that feeling and it's gonna say shit man there's no more food around. Burn into my internal energy reserve. That's the whole fucking point. Since I'm not full of fucking carbs right now where's it gonna pull that energy from? It's gonna gradually suck out some stored oils that are separating my chest striations from my skin.\nEmbedded text: EATING HUNGRY STARVING WHAT ARE YOU DOING? EAT BRO?

So a lot of this raw meat stuff has gotten popular with people like Liver King and CarnivoreMD eating some of their meat completely raw. Now, while you can do this with high quality meat, the reality is a lot of people can't get their hands on high quality meat and you really don't know the source. If you read Richard Wrangham's book called Fire, he's an anthropologist that talks about the invention of cooking and how this actually increased basically our ability to transport protein, one, our ability to digest protein because it does help with digestion, cooking does, it helps break down some of those proteins, making it easier for the body to absorb. There's no problem if you enjoy eating some raw meat, but you absolutely do not have to. I don't. Now, occasionally we went to a steakhouse in Austin and we did basically almost have some raw meat. We like barely seared the little Wagyu skewers, but you don't need to eat raw meat. You don't need to eat blood. There's not some benefits of that that are so vast that that's something you should be doing. And you can get sick from raw meat, you know, especially of course raw poultry, never eat raw poultry. You can definitely get salmonella and you can get ill from that. And if you're going to Walmart or Safeway and buying some old steak and eating that raw, that is never something I would do. Just cook your meat. You're going to be fine.\nEmbedded text: Raw Meat And Blood Diet raw meat and blood King and of their meat completely now while you can with high quality meat the reality is a can't get quality meat really don't if you read Richard called Fire he's an about the invention of this actually increase basically our ability protein one to digest because it with digestion cooking does break down those proteins the body to absorb there's no you enjoy raw meat not have I don't we went in Austin did basically almost have we like wagyu skewers but you to eat need to eat blood there's not some benefits so vast that that's doing can get sick from especially of raw poultry definitely get can get that you're going or Safeway some old eating that that is do just cook\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

Honestly I could talk about this subject for an hour on a podcast but these types of videos only reach people when theyre as short as possible. Here are some additional notes: First things first: of the 18-20 sets I do in a typical workout, 3-4 of them might not be to complete failure. This is because I want to grow muscle without completely frying my central nervous system and doing sets with reps in reserve helps accomplish this. I also want to say that of the 6 exercises in a workout, 2 of them will be extremely heavy, 2 will be moderate weight and 2 will be light to moderate weight. I just dont want you to think that Im 1 rep maxing the whole exercise hahaha. Secondly: if you think leaving reps in reserve is optimal for gaining muscle and thats your ultimate goal then ignore this video. The reason why I made this video was to bring more of a philosophical perspective than a scientific one. Not everyones trying to step on stage and look like an IFBB pro. Most of us want to feel confident, improve our health and grow as an individual. Going to the gym and training either way Ive mentioned will do this. I just personally believe that training until failure gives you more character armour. Life can be fucking tough and in the worst moments of our existence, theres no such thing as not going until failure. I want to@make sure Im prepared for those moments. I hope you guys enjoy #gym #gymmotivation #training #weightlifting\nAudio transcript: you train until failure or leave reps in reserve? There's no clear-cut answer to this. I'm just gonna tell you guys what I believe and you guys let me know. If you guys watch my videos you clearly know I'm on team train to failure. Now I don't go to failure every single set but pretty much every single one. When you're lifting very heavy and you're going to failure you get a ton of anxiety before you go to the gym or before you do that lift. And if that anxiety is crippling you to the point where you actually don't even want to go to the gym anymore I strongly suggest you don't train like that. But personally for me I actually want the fucking anxiety. I want to drive to the gym shitting my fucking pants knowing my first lift is gonna be an absolute fucking war. Doing five sets of like 18 I just don't find that enjoyable at all. I want to be tested. I want to go to the gym and I want to fucking get tested and I want to pass the fucking test because that's what makes me want to go to the gym so badly. Let's just assume that leaving reps in reserve gives you 10% more optimal muscle gain. I would rather leave that on the table in exchange for the mental fortitude. Going as heavy as possible and going until failure it fucking hurts. It's painful. It sucks and I'm scared of that. I'm fucking scared. Everybody's fucking scared of that and that's exactly why I do it. I know this borders the line of being sadistic and obviously there's a limit to it but the point is is that sometimes you just got to do things because they fucking suck. Now training to failure for me sucks but it's also the most enjoyable way to train. This is obviously the least scientific fucking video you've ever seen in your life and this is not me trying to tell you what you should do. I'm just personally putting my two cents in the pot and explaining to you why I train to failure. I hope you guys fucking enjoy it and you don't think I'm an absolute maniac. I kind of am.\nEmbedded text: @billylovebaby\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following subtypes: Muscularity Self\u2011Objectification, Leanness Self\u2011Objectification, Muscle Dissatisfaction, Rigid Food Rules, Unsafe Food, Cheat Meals, Anabolic Steroids, Legal APEDs, Hormone Therapy, Excessive Exercise, Predebting, Maladaptive Coping, Exercise\u2011Induced Functional Impairment, Toxic Motivation, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant.\n\nOnly output the specific subtype label, no explanations or other text.

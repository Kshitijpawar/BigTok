Steroids influence individual cells, causing them to produce proteins. These proteins are problematic. The liver, for example, can develop tumors and cancer. Steroid users may also develop peliosis hepatis, a rare condition in which blood-filled cysts appear on the liver. Tumors and cysts can both rupture and cause internal bleeding. Steroids are also bad for your heart. Overuse can result in heart attack and stroke. Steroid use can result in atherosclerosis, a condition in which fat deposits inside arteries disrupt blood flow. A heart attack can occur when blood flow to the heart is blocked. A stroke may follow if blood flow to the brain is restricted. I hope that you have learned something new from this video.

This was day one of the newest cycle, the one that I'm currently on right now. And this is day 45 on the cycle that I'm currently on right now. Now I'm sure you're thinking, oh, well, the only reason he looks like that is because he's on steroids. And I got a little secret for you, Timmy. I wouldn't look like that if I didn't do the basic three things to build muscle, meaning diet, training, and recovery. It's literally so easy to build muscle. Sleep eight hours a night, eat your body weight times 1.12 or 1.25 in protein a day, and train hard and have fun with the training. If you do all that, then you do steroids. It will accelerate the shit out of it. Steroids don't replace any of the foundational three. They only make them work better. I challenge any of you that are watching this video to take steroids and not do one of those basic three and still put on a shit ton of muscle in 45 days. You cannot do it. It will not be done. Taking steroids is literally just putting turbo on your car. It's not going to do anything if your car doesn't even have gas in it.\nEmbedded text: How quickly steroids work...IT How quickly steroids work...\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.

Honestly I could talk about this subject for an hour on a podcast but these types of videos only reach people when theyre as short as possible. Here are some additional notes: First things first: of the 18-20 sets I do in a typical workout, 3-4 of them might not be to complete failure. This is because I want to grow muscle without completely frying my central nervous system and doing sets with reps in reserve helps accomplish this. I also want to say that of the 6 exercises in a workout, 2 of them will be extremely heavy, 2 will be moderate weight and 2 will be light to moderate weight. I just dont want you to think that Im 1 rep maxing the whole exercise hahaha. Secondly: if you think leaving reps in reserve is optimal for gaining muscle and thats your ultimate goal then ignore this video. The reason why I made this video was to bring more of a philosophical perspective than a scientific one. Not everyones trying to step on stage and look like an IFBB pro. Most of us want to feel confident, improve our health and grow as an individual. Going to the gym and training either way Ive mentioned will do this. I just personally believe that training until failure gives you more character armour. Life can be fucking tough and in the worst moments of our existence, theres no such thing as not going until failure. I want to@make sure Im prepared for those moments. I hope you guys enjoy #gym #gymmotivation #training #weightlifting\nAudio transcript: you train until failure or leave reps in reserve? There's no clear-cut answer to this. I'm just gonna tell you guys what I believe and you guys let me know. If you guys watch my videos you clearly know I'm on team train to failure. Now I don't go to failure every single set but pretty much every single one. When you're lifting very heavy and you're going to failure you get a ton of anxiety before you go to the gym or before you do that lift. And if that anxiety is crippling you to the point where you actually don't even want to go to the gym anymore I strongly suggest you don't train like that. But personally for me I actually want the fucking anxiety. I want to drive to the gym shitting my fucking pants knowing my first lift is gonna be an absolute fucking war. Doing five sets of like 18 I just don't find that enjoyable at all. I want to be tested. I want to go to the gym and I want to fucking get tested and I want to pass the fucking test because that's what makes me want to go to the gym so badly. Let's just assume that leaving reps in reserve gives you 10% more optimal muscle gain. I would rather leave that on the table in exchange for the mental fortitude. Going as heavy as possible and going until failure it fucking hurts. It's painful. It sucks and I'm scared of that. I'm fucking scared. Everybody's fucking scared of that and that's exactly why I do it. I know this borders the line of being sadistic and obviously there's a limit to it but the point is is that sometimes you just got to do things because they fucking suck. Now training to failure for me sucks but it's also the most enjoyable way to train. This is obviously the least scientific fucking video you've ever seen in your life and this is not me trying to tell you what you should do. I'm just personally putting my two cents in the pot and explaining to you why I train to failure. I hope you guys fucking enjoy it and you don't think I'm an absolute maniac. I kind of am.\nEmbedded text: @billylovebaby\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.

I drink about half a cup and drink this every single morning on an empty stomach. Kefir contains amazing probiotics that are good for your gut health, for your skin health, for your overall digestive health. If you're somebody that doesn't want to break the bank with coconut cult, kefir is a great alternative. I literally get this entire thing for like $4 at Trader Joe's and I personally like to get the plain one because this doesn't contain any added sugars like some of the other flavored ones do. It contains the same live probiotics that coconut cult does and this $5 a bottle of kefir literally lasts me about two, two and a half weeks.\nEmbedded text: Kefir > coconut cult for a healthy gut, clear skin and a snatched waist\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.

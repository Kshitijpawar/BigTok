In general, women don't really see men as like a fixed number on a scale. We pretty quickly divide you into three different looks categories. On one end of the spectrum is male model, I know all my friends are gonna think he's hot. This is rare to see in real life, it's usually celebrities. Then there's absolutely not, which is different for all women. My friend would never date a skinny guy under any circumstances. But I really like skinny guys. But the vast majority of men fall into the other category, which ranges from meh to kinda cute. And as we get to know you, there are tons of factors that literally change your physical appearance to us. Everything from the way your voice sounds, to how you smell, to how funny you are. And that can nosedive you down into absolutely not, or bring you up to I want him status. Which is so much hotter than even the male model category.\nEmbedded text: How women conceptualize men's looks Yes please explain how women conceptualize sure I'd love to explain in general women don't really see men as like a fixed number on a 1-10 scale we pretty quickly divide you into 3 different looks categories on one end of the spectrum I know all my friends \"Male Model\" Conventional \"super hot\" are gonna think he's hot this is rare to see in real life it's usually celebrities then there's \"absolutely not\" \"Absolutely Not\" \"Male Model\" Conventional \"super hot\" which is different for all women For some it's a height, hair color, body type, etc my friend would never date a skinny guy under any circumstances but I really like skinny guys the vast majority of men fall into the \"other\" category \u2728\u2728Other\u2728\u2728 \"Meh\" which ranges from \"Meh\" \"Kinda Cute\" to \"kinda cute\" and as we get to know you there are tons of factors \u2728\u2728Other\u2728\u2728 \"Meh\" \"Kinda Cute\" Voice Personality How you treat us Attitude Humor Skills Empathy Views on life Confidence Smell Smoothness Views on women Love language Generosity Caring nature Love for kids/pets that literally change your physical appearance to us *These things are like YOUR make-up the way your voice sounds to how you smell to how funny you are and that can nose dive you down into \"absolutely not\" \u201cI want him\u201d \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 or bring you up to \"I want him\" status which is so much hotter than even the \"male model\" category\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.

Testosterone enhances lipolysis, the process by which stored fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. This results in a reduction in fat cell size, contributing to a leaner body composition. Testosterone stimulates the oxidation of fatty acids, which is the process of converting fatty acids into energy. Higher levels of testosterone can increase the body's capacity to burn fat for fuel, ultimately boosting metabolic rate. If youre concerned about symptoms of low T, reach out to your primary doctor to discuss, or us here at Hendrx Health. We will screen your essential biomarkers and determine if TRT is right for you. www.HendrxHealth.com #menshealth#testosterone #testosteronereplacementtherapy #trt#lowt#lowtestosterone #testosteronetherapy\nAudio transcript: And then of course, it also stimulates and modifies fat cells and muscle cells.

We see the exact opposite. So if someone doesnt train hard its not because theyre science-based. Its because... theyre just a person who doesn't train hard. #fitness #gym #workout #bodybuilding #gains\nAudio transcript: I don't think I've ever seen a science-based lifter who actually trains hard. Freaking dorks. I've heard a lot of people say things like that, but what they don't realize is that if you don't train hard, then you're actually not science-based by default, because the science literally shows that to maximize gains, you do need to be training sufficiently close to failure. So whether you consider yourself science-based or non-science-based or something in between, hard training is always a non-negotiable no matter what, and it's not something you can ever get around regardless of your overall training philosophy.\nEmbedded text: I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A \"SCIENCE BASED\" LIFTER WHO ACTUALLY TRAINS HARD.

I was reading about this man back in the day, so I'd like to thank the VFW very much for giving me this award. It means more to me than anything I've ever received in my entire life. I'd like to thank my grandfather, Sergeant Jack Gardner, who is now deceased. This would be the happiest day of his entire life. I'd like to thank my mom up here, who... Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Oh my... God. Oh my. Thank you. Who never picked me up. Who never picked me up when I fell. She taught me how to get up when I was knocked down. I thank my uncle for always being there for me. And I thank all you out here who fought in these wars. You have no idea how big of a deal this is to me. I was not always this strong guy you see. I went through a lot of hard times in my life to get here today. And a story I'll tell you with real quick. I tried once to get in the Air Force to be an Air Force pararescueman. And I quit for fear of the water. I was 175 pounds. I left the Air Force four years later at 300 pounds. I went from 175 to 300 pounds. There's a long story in there on how that came to be. But I sat around and read a book on the Medal of Honor. And those guys, all I wanted to be was an uncommon man. And my whole life I was not that, much worse than that. But I read stories about men like you Doc who had the courage to jump on grenades and stuff like that. So I came home one day from working at a job called Ecolab where I sprayed for cockroaches. Made $1,000 a month, weighing 300 pounds. And I got home and I watched a show on Discovery Channel of guys carrying boats and logs, Navy SEAL training. And I decided to make a change in my life. And I called the recruiter up and he asked me these questions. He had to meet a certain height and weight limit. I was six foot one and 300 pounds. He laughed at me. Seven other recruiters laughed at me. One recruiter finally said, come on in, I'm too busy to talk to you on the phone. He didn't know how much I weighed. I walked into the recruiter's office and he looked at me and he said, you're fat and you're black. Got someone to be a Navy SEAL. I didn't know there'd only been 35 African American Navy SEALs at that time in over 70 years. He said, I basically had to lose 106 pounds in less than three months because of my age. I was getting too old. I came back three months later, 106 pounds lighter. I, thank you. Thank you. And literally, I spent 18 months going through BUDS, which is a six month program. Went through three Hell Weeks. That is where I met Marcus Luttrell, Danny Deets, Michael Murphy, another Medal of Honor winner. I went through Hell Week with all these guys, real heroes. I am not a hero. I served with real heroes. And from there, I went on to raise over two million dollars for Special Operations Warrior Foundation. But, I'm gonna end you with this right here. I have the most respect I can possibly muster up for all of you in this room. I know what it takes to be a combat soldier and I used to look for courage. I thought courage was a man who won the Medal of Honor. It is. But courage is a man who's willing to put those boots on every single day of his life to go out there and fight for this country when nobody even knows what the hell they're doing or where the hell they're at. You do it for the man besides you. Thank you. People cheer.\nEmbedded text: MOST EMOTIONAL SPEECH YOU'LL EVER HEAR DAVID GOGGINS\n\n###TASK###\nClassify the video into one of the following types: Relationship to Body, Relationship to Food, Supplement Abuse, Relationship to Exercise, Relationship to Masculinity, or Irrelevant. \n\nOnly output the type label, no explanations or other text.
